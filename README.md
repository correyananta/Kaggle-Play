# Kaggle Competition
- [Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/iphton/Kaggle-Competition/blob/gh-pages/Titanic%20Competition/Notebook/Predict%20survival%20on%20the%20Titanic.ipynb)<br>
In this kaggle challenge, we're asked to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. In particular, we're asked to apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.

- [Digit Classification](https://github.com/iphton/Kaggle-Competition/tree/gh-pages/Digit%20Recognizer)<br>
The goal in this competition is to take an image of a handwritten single digit, and determine what that digit is. For every **ImageId** in the test set, we should predict the correct label.
